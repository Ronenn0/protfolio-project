# Ronen Azam – Fullstack Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases who I am, what I’ve built, and what I can bring to the table as a passionate fullstack developer.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m **Ronen Azam**, a fullstack developer from Shefa-‘Amr, Israel. I speak **Arabic, Hebrew, and English** fluently and bring with me a strong background in leadership and discipline from my military service in **Golani and Magav**, where I served as a commander and participated in the October 7th battle at Moshav Pega.

I began coding in 2019, creating small games and tools without any AI support, and continue to sharpen my skills with both frontend and backend technologies.
